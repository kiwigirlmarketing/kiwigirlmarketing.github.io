  <p>I can't remember anything<br>
    Can't tell if this is true or dream<br>
    Deep down inside I feel to scream<br>
    This terrible silence stops me<br>
  </p>
  <p>Now that the war is through with me<br>
    I'm waking up, I cannot see<br>
    That there is not much left of me<br>
    Nothing is real but pain now<br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Hold my breath as I wish for death<br>
    Oh please, God, wake me</strong><br>
  </p>
  <p>Back to the world that's much too real<br>
    In pumps life that I must feel<br>
    But can't look forward to reveal<br>
    Look to the time when I'll live<br>
  </p>
  <p>Fed through the tube that sticks in me<br>
    Just like a wartime novelty<br>
    Tied to machines that make me be<br>
    Cut this life off from me<br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Hold my breath as I wish for death<br>
    Oh please, God, wake me</strong><br>
  </p>
  <p>Now the world is gone, I'm just one<br>
    Oh God, help me<strong><br>
   </strong> Hold my breath as I wish for death<br>
    Oh please, God, help me<br>
  </p>
  <p>Darkness imprisoning me<br>
    All that I see<br>
    Absolute horror<br>
    I cannot live<br>
    I cannot die<br>
    Trapped in myself<br>
    Body my holding cell<br>
  </p>
  <p>Landmine has taken my sight<br>
    Taken my speech<br>
    Taken my hearing<br>
    Taken my arms<br>
    Taken my legs<br>
    Taken my soul<br>
    Left me with life in hell</p>
